Just a small collection of discord bots i made for my own benefit.

You can start by doing

`pip install -U discord.py`

Create a file name `.env` in the same directory as main.py and don't forget to install

`pip install -U python-dotenv`

to store the discord bot token in the following format:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
