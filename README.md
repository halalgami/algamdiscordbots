Just a small collection of discord bots i made for my own benefit.

Special thanks to:

and

for the inspiration and guidance.

main.py currently contains the meme bot, which fetches the freshest memes from the following RSS feeds:

    https://memebase.cheezburger.com/rss

You can start by running

`pip install -U discord.py`

Create a file name `.env` in the same directory as main.py and don't forget to install

`pip install -U python-dotenv`

to store the discord bot token in the following format:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`
